## Key Implementation Details

### Country Selection Logic

- Root `/` page shows country selector only
- Selection is saved to `localStorage` with key `armh_market`
- On subsequent visits, user is redirected to their selected market
- Navbar includes country switcher to return to root

### Path Isolation

- All `/uk` internal links point to `/uk/*` paths
- All `/uae` internal links point to `/uae/*` paths
- No cross-market navigation links

### Pricing Strategy

- **UK**: Shows "Custom / month" with quote CTAs
- **UAE**: Shows specific AED pricing (e.g., "AED 1,999/mo")
- UAE pricing includes "All prices exclude 5% UAE VAT" disclaimer

### Regional Vocabulary

- **UK**: HMRC, Companies House, Corporation Tax, MTD
- **UAE**: FTA, Corporate Tax (9%), WPS, ESR, UBO

### Color Palette

- `charcoal-950` (#0D0F0E) - Hero backgrounds
